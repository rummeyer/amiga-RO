RO  is a new Intuition-controlled, fully user-configurable file manager for
OS  2.04  and newer.  RO's mighty features will assist and help you on your
daily  work  with  your  Amiga.   With  RO  there is no need to learn those
cryptic  shell  commands, because you have the complete power of your Amiga
in  one  hand.

Due to the usage of MUI you are able to configure the look and feel of this
tool  as  you like it.  MUI is the Magic User Interface developed by Stefan
Stuntz  which should be installed on every Amiga.  It is an object oriented
system  to  create  and  maintain  graphical user interfaces.  Users of MUI
based  applications  have  the ability to customize nearly every pixel of a
programs interface according to their personal taste.
