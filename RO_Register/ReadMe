Dear RO-User!

Thank you very much for registrating.  It's nice to see that you appreciate
my  work.   Your shareware contribution helps me to continue developing and
improving RO.

This  disk contains your personal key file ( in the 'KeyFile' directory and
several times in the 'Backup' directory ).  Just copy it to the "S:" drawer
of  your system partition and restart RO.  From now on, you can use all the
features  of  RO without any restrictions.  Alternatively, you can copy the
key file to "L:" or in the same directory where you copied the executable.

The  key  file  contains your name and address.  Please do not give it away
and ensure that nobody but you has access to it.

You  will  find  the latest release of RO unpacked in the root directory of
this disk.  Please do not spread this archive, even if it seems to be newer
than  the  last  public release.

Some  files  may  be  damaged so I included a packed backup in the 'Backup'
directory.   Should  you  experience  any problems or have ideas for future
development,  please  don't  hesitate  to  contact  me at the address above
(e-mail preferred).



                      Thank you for your support,

                                Oliver.
